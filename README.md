### Modules
#### `logger.js`
listens for and responds to events by doing a console.log() with something useful about the event.

#### `app.js`
Reads the file from the file system. Converts itâ€™s contents to upper case. Writes it back to the file system
Following the write operation, report back to the user (console.log) the status.

#### `event.js`
Creates an event module that has a single event emitter instance

#### Running the app
* `npm start` - Reads `123.txt` turns in to uppercase. Then emits to logger.js to console.log() onto the terminal.

#### Tests
`npm test` - Will run test for functions that I have written
